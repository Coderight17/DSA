Leetcode 75:- Sort Colours

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order 
red, white, and blue. We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.You must solve this problem without using 
the library's sort function.

SOLUTION:-
The approach I use is to have 3 variables(say x, y, z) for counting the no of 0s, 1s and 2s respectively.Then we count and increment the variables. After that 
I fill 0 from indexes 0 to x-1, 1 from indexes x to x+y-1 and the rest with 2. Done and dusted.
