# DSA
Some of the important DSA problems from various platforms(Mostly Leetcode)
This repository mainly contains the various DSA problems from various topics. This is a personal repository and I use this to just revise some of the DSA concepts which would be useful for interviews and in general as a software engineer.
I use Python in this repository, as the lines of code are fewer in python, it is relatively simpler to code and also to read the code in Python compared to other languages I know like C++, Java, Javascript etc.
