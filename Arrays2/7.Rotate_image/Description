Leetcode 48: Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.



So bruh, this rotate image. We need to rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise
i.e.
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

should be

7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

Ig this can be done in 2 steps:- Transpose the matrix and then reverse the rows.

Simple.
