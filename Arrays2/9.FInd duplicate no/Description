DSA 10/ Leetcode 287: Find the duplicate no
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.


Given an array of n+1 integers, with all elements in the range [1, n] (both inclusive, I mean anybody knows square brackets are notation for both inclusive, but still..)
we need to find which is the one number among [1,n] that repeats in the array. There has to be one that repeats due to pigeonhole principle. 

Solution:-
The first approach is the simple brute force approach where I take
