Leetcode 73)
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
You must do it in place.

THis is the problem. I do it using the brute force approach using no extra space, but having like O(n3) time complexity using a better approach using some
extra space but lesser time complexity, and then finally, an optimal approach only using O(1) space and O(mn) time complexity.


Here are some of the things to be noted about the brute force approach:-
1) It passes 200/202 test cases in leetcode
2) The test cases it does not pass includes -1 in them, and according to my code, the elements to be changed to 0 are marked with -1 and hence, the ones which were
originally marked as -1 are also marked as 0, leading to 2 incorrect test cases.
3) I will try to improve my code to pass those test cases as well, the idea I have right now involves changing the data type of the marker in order to prevent overlap,
like put 'a' instead of -1 and then change all the cells containing 'a' to 0.

If this or any other approach works for anybody, do let me know.
