Leetcode 118
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

This is how I arrived at the solution of the problem:-



So bruh, this Pascal's triangle in Python.

1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
1 5 10 10 5 1
.
.
.

So, the pattern that I observe here is that(no of entries in a row), 
row0-> 1
row1-> 2
row2-> 3
.
.

Another pattern that I observe is, row i has 1 at 0th position and the ith position.

In the middle, matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j] + matrix[i-1][j-1]

So, cracked it. Now, I need to code it.

class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        pascals_triangle = []
        for i in range(numRows):
            row = [0]*(i+1)
            pascals_triangle.append(row)
            for j in range(len(row)):
                if j == 0 or j== i:
                    pascals_triangle[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    pascals_triangle[i][j] = pascals_triangle[i-1][j] + pascals_triangle[i-1][j-1]
        return pascals_triangle
